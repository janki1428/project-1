#### Team Swift: Lucas Monaco, Diya Patel, Janki Patel, Mark Habeb
This project is exploring Taylor Swift's music, as reported by Spotify. Data was pulled from the Spotify API and includes values for features of music that Spotify defines. We will be exploring the relationship between some of these metrics, trying to find a predictor for what makes a song popular, and looking at any potential differences in popularity between original and re-released albums. 
<br> The research questions this project explores are: 
1. Is there any relationship/correlation between tempo and valence (musical positiveness)? 
2. Is there any relationship/correlation between energy and danceability?
3. What is the difference in popularity between newer releases of albums (specifically albums that were re-released as “Taylor’s Version”) as compared to the originals?
4. Which, if any, of the numerical metrics that Spotify assigns to songs are good predictors (that is, strongly related in regression) for popularity?
